# 🌌 COSMOCODE — Explore Your Codebase as a Galaxy

> **An AI-powered code analyzer that transforms source code into an interactive 3D galaxy visualization.**

**Built with:** Python • Tornado • Three.js • GitHub Copilot

---

## 🏆 Hackathon Track

**Track:** Creative Apps  
**Hackathon:** Agents League Hackathon 2026


# ✨ Overview

COSMOCODE takes any codebase — uploaded locally or pulled directly from GitHub — and transforms it into a navigable **3D galaxy visualization**.

Classes and files become **Stars**, functions become **Planets**, code issues become **Black Holes**, and dependencies become **Orbits**.

This allows developers to:

* Understand architecture instantly
* Identify complexity hotspots
* Discover risky code
* Visualize dependencies
* Explore repositories interactively

Additionally, COSMOCODE introduces **WorkIQ**, a layer that simulates team activity and commit intelligence to add organizational context to the visualization.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern software projects often contain thousands of files, multiple modules, and complex dependency structures. Understanding how different components interact can be challenging, especially for:

👩‍💻 New contributors joining a project
🏢 Development teams working on large codebases
📚 Students learning software architecture
🔍 Developers performing maintenance and debugging

Traditional file explorers and repository views provide limited insight into the overall structure of a project. Developers often spend significant time navigating directories and tracing dependencies manually.

CosmoCode solves this problem by providing an interactive, visual, and AI-enhanced representation of software repositories.

2. **AI Processing Engine**

   * The core engine analyzes the query, identifies intent, and determines the required actions.
   * Context management and prompt orchestration ensure relevant and coherent responses.

3. **Tool Integration Layer**

   * External tools and services are invoked when necessary to retrieve data, perform calculations, or enhance response quality.
   * Tool-calling capabilities allow CosmoCode to extend beyond simple text generation.

4. **LLM Intelligence Layer**

   * Gemini AI powers natural language understanding, reasoning, and response generation.
   * The model processes user requests and synthesizes information into meaningful outputs.

5. **GitHub Copilot Development Layer**

   * GitHub Copilot assists during development by generating code suggestions, accelerating feature implementation, improving productivity, and helping maintain code quality.
   * Copilot was used for code completion, debugging assistance, documentation support, and rapid prototyping.

6. **GitHub Repository & Version Control**

   * Source code, documentation, architecture diagrams, and project assets are maintained through GitHub.
   * Version control ensures collaboration, traceability, and continuous improvement.

7. **Response Generation Layer**

   * Processed results are formatted into user-friendly outputs.
   * Responses may include explanations, generated code, insights, recommendations, or educational content.

### 🔄 Workflow

| Step | Process | Output |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | User provides a GitHub repository URL | Repository selected for analysis |
| 2 | Repository Analyzer scans the repository | Project structure extracted |
| 3 | Dependency Mapper processes imports and relationships | Dependency graph generated |
| 4 | Code Constellation Engine analyzes code elements | Classes and functions mapped |
